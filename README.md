# Keto Recipe Finder

This project is intended to be an API that serves up keto recipies, and then converts them to a shopping list.
The v0 idea is to first serve up recipes. The v1 idea is to convert the recipes into a grocery list. This API will be built
using Node.js + Express.js. We will research API's that return recipies, and our API
will filter those out to show Keto recipies with a filter for Vegan and Gluten Free.
